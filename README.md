## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

The ECOAct app aims to create an eco-friendlier environment by making ecological habits more fun and rewarding. By using the app, people will become more aware of their day-to-day habits and how they impact the world and keep track of their carbon footprint.
This app is designed to be very intuitive and easy to use, so it can be used by everyone, especially by those who are looking to make this world greener every day.
Our planet suffers everyday due to our bad habits and sometimes it seems that we alone won’t make a difference, but the ECOAct app is looking to show you otherwise by making a balance of all our users ECOActions, so now you will be able to see that all of us can change the world for better, including you.
